        Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and
        editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the
        character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962 (cover dated March 1963) and received his own title
        with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team,
        the Avengers, alongside Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the
        Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's creation.
